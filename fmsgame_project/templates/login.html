<p>Welcome to our mobile game that's so Alpha it's almost Omega.</p>
<p>The game works as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go outside, or somewhere your phone can get GPS signal
  <li>Open this page (the one you're reading right now) on your Android/iPhone. Basically any phone with GPS and Google Maps.
  <li>Click below to Login by using a Google account
  <li>Allow the service to get your location (you might want to tick remember for this site - we'll be wanting this again)
  <li>Look at the map. It should show pins that represent FixMyStreet reports near you that we think might never have been fixed.
  <li>Walk, cycle or drive until you are at the site of the nearest pin.
  <li>Click on the pin on your map, and open the link.
  <li>Select whether the problem is now fixed, not fixed, or whether you can't find it.
  <li>Win points and appear on the League table.
</ol>


<p>Please email all complaints to /dev/null - we're going to the pub.</p>
